# WellesleyFresher
Partnered project for CS230 (Data Structures) at Wellesley College

A program that allows the user to select the ingredients they will need for a recipe and will then make a shopping plan, informing the user of which dining halls have the ingredients they need. If two dining halls have the same ingredient, it chooses the closer one.
